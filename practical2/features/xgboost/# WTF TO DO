# WTF TO DO

- KNN? -- probably not
- Submit only Random Forest, doing once?
- Submit only XGBoost, doing once?
- Mix XGBoost and Random Forest? Whichever one does better for None...?
- SkyNet?
- Mix Henrique's features with XGBoost
- Prune Henrique's features -- it's using all the data rn


Types of plots for this data?

- Predictive power of each/particular syscall. Like the load_dll thing.


# Tasks:
Josh:
	- Writeup!
	- SkyNet?

Victor:
	- Prune Henrique's features and run XGBoost on it
	- Try doing predictive power plots
	- Clean up code & repo

Decide which 3 things to submit to Kaggle. Probably XGBoost solo, RandomForest solo (if XGBoost solo < 82%)
and maybe a mix. But probably won't work -- issue is with None's, and malware could even be trying to hide somehow.
